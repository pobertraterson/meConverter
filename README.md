# Warnings
The current version of the project will only start specifically what it says it will do in the Main.java file. So if (for now) if you want to encode a specific file, you will need to point to the path of the file in the Main.java file.
There will be some example files added.

This project is still in development and is not finished. Issues and unexpected behaviour ahead.

# Building
To build, you will need to download [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). Read the documentation on how to build using Maven.

Made with love by the team (Medium Effort Solutions)
